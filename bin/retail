=head1 NAME

retail - a log file tailing utility

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage: retail [-d] [-h] [-s <state dir>] -f <logfile pattern>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Usage: retail [-d] [-h] [-s <state dir>] -f <logfile pattern>

retail is a log file tailer in the spirit of logtail that keeps state in
an SDBM file and can follow all log files matching a regular expression
pattern.

For example, to follow logs created with a time stamp suffix
of the form access.YYYY-MM-DD (note the escapes for shell):
    retail -f /var/log/apache/access.\\\\d{4}-\\\\d{2}-\\\\d{2}

retail compares the file name of the log file (but NOT any parts of the path)
to the regular expression when selecting files to follow.

=head1 CREDITS

This is a simple re-working of <retail|https://github.com/rowanredbeard/retail>,
which is an extension of logtail (part of the
<logcheck|http://logcheck.org/index.html> project).
